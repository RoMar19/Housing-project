# Interactive-Frontend-Development-Milestone-Project 2

This is the second Milestone Project based on the first one "User Centric Front-End Development Project: Milestone 1 - InMadrid.com / Housing for Young Professionals & Students".
Implementing JavaScript functionalities: Google Map, Send Mail with emailJS and first steps to filter listing. Listing is a JSON file that I will use to make the selection options for searchapartment.html page and searchappartment.ES.html.
Housing website with Welcome page, Search Apartment for tenants where I have added Google Map with markers for the listing options and Rent out Apartment page including dropdown with Home Staging services page and “Contact Us” form with Email JS Templates for owners/landlords.

## UX Process Design: ##
All pages on this site include "Navigation" and "Footer" with collapsible navigation bar with a dropdown menu for Landlords to learn about How to rent out and Home Staging services. The Footer has links to contact info. with my own email address (rmf1312@hotmail.com, info@inmadrid.com doesn't exist yet) and Social Media links to the login pages of the sites (not real social links created yet for the brand InMadrid.): Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram.
The colors used in this project were:
"#434738" (Dark grey. Text Color) "#B5D43C" (Olive Green. Text color, Buttons) "#D9EF81" (Light Olive Green. Background, Button) "#F7F7F7" (Light Grey. Nav Text, Background) "#E6E3E3" (Lighter Grey. Navbar Hover Effect)
I have imported the fonts from Google Fonts: "'Nunito', sans-serif; “.”


## Technology used ##
For this project I have used HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap 4 (4.3.1) for the layout, forms, jumbotron... and added my own CSS to style the website, using also Google Fonts to add new fonts and Font Awesome 5 for icons.
This second Milestone include Java Scrip functionalities: 
- Using Google Map platform to implement Map with markers to the listing address on searchapartment.html and searchapartment.ES.html 
- Email JS to send Email with Auto-replay. Received emails from "Contac Us" at rentout.html and rentout.ES.html are linked to my Google account). 
- jQuery to add listing and filter listing options in future. 
- JSON file created for listing (data base).


## Testing  ##
Testing with Chrome Developer Tools. Resizing screen to see how pages respond to different sizes: forms, images and layout. Responsive design successfully achieved. 
Check in links and buttons one by one to match with the correct pages. Code HTML5 and CSS3 validated with W3C Validator without errors. 
Testing responsiveness and layout for small screens with different mobile brands from friends. 
Tested "Contact Us" Form at "rentout" page with required inputs in order to be submitted. Google map and EmailJS functionality and initial steps to filter listing tested with Chrome Developer Tools and jshint.com, not errors fund.


## Deployment ##
This project is hosted using Github pages, directly from the master branch. 
Using Gitpod terminal to add, commit and push my work to Github Website. Different commits during the development process editing, updating or changing files. Errors found during deployment process caused by C9 AWS, it doesn't recognize my Github account. After tutor's help we have to "force" my work overwriting my previous commits, I lost 38 commits, new ones created before submitting the project to update latest changes. 
New commits to save changes done during the implementation of JavaScript functionalities.
