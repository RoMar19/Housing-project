UX Process Design:
This website is aimed to search for housing options in Madrid for young professionals and students. It is easily navigated with an easily understandable collapsible navigation bar. Including a Sing Up/Sing In plus English or Spanish language option buttons.

All information is displayed clear and easy to see and search options. 2 Different parts are created, 1 for tenants and 1 for owners/landlords who desire to rent a house in Madrid with "Contact us" option to explain how we work.

In this project, I have created a 6 page website. This is a basic website for a future Housing project using Java Script and other advanced languages to include new functionalities as real listing with database, filters to the search option, maps, etc. We are using fake pictures and fake contact details, it will show real information in the future.

Features:
All pages on this site include "Navigation" and "Footer". With collapsible navigation bar with a dropdown menu for Landlords to learn about How to rent out and Home Staging services. The Footer has links to contact info. with my own email address (rmf1312@hotmail.com, info@inmadrid.com doesn't exist yet) and Social Media links to the login pages of the sites (not real social links created yet for the brand InMadrid.): Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram.

The colors used in this project were:

"#434738" (Dark grey. Text Color) "#B5D43C" (Olive Green. Text color, Buttons) "#D9EF81" (Light Olive Green. Background, Button) "#F7F7F7" (Light Grey. Nav Text, Background ) "#E6E3E3" (Lighter Grey. Navbar Hover Effect)

I have imported the fonts from Google Fonts: "'Nunito', sans-serif;"."

Technology used
For this project I have used HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap 4 (4.3.1) for the layout, forms, jumbotron... and added my own CSS to style the website, using also Google Fonts to add new fonts and Font Awesome 5 for icons.

Testing
Testing with Chrome Developer Tools. Resizing screen to see how pages respond to different sizes: forms, images and layout. Responsive design successfully achieved. Check in links and buttons one by one to match with the correct pages. Code HTML5 and CSS3 validated with W3C Validator without errors. Testing responsiveness and layout for small screens with different mobile brands from friends. Tested "Contact Us" Form at "rentout" page with "required" inputs in order to be submitted.

Deployment
This project is hosted using Github pages, directly from the master branch. Using C9 AWS terminal to add, commit and push my work to Github Website. Different commits during the development process editing, updating or changing files. Errors found during deployment process caused by C9 AWS, it doesn't recognize my Github account. After tutor's help we have to "force" my work overwriting my previous commits, I lost 38 commits, new ones created before submitting the project to update latest changes.
